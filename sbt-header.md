# Integration with `sbt-header`

If you use [sbt-header](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-header) for creating/updating your file headers according to your project's license you can benefit from our `sbt-github-header` module which pre-fills header template with downloaded Github values. To use it, just add the following line to your `plugins.sbt` file

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.alejandrohdezma" % "sbt-github-header" % "0.11.1")
```

!> Important! So we don't force a version of sbt-header, it is requested as a ["Provided"](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html) dependency so you'll need to provide your own version of [sbt-header](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-header).
:::

## What does this integration do?

Populates the `headerLicense` setting from [`sbt-header`](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-header) with values extracted from Github by `SbtGithubPlugin`:

- **Year**: The information stored in `yearRange`.
- **Copyright Owner**: The information stored in `copyrightOwner`, provided by the own integration
plugin. Defaults to `organizationName` value if there is no value for `organizationHomepage` or
`organizationName <organizationHomepage>` if there is.

The `headerLicenseStyle` setting from the `HeaderPlugin` will be used to set the style of the autogenerated headers.

### Example

For example, given a project with:

 - an Apache-2.0 license...
 - given that the repository start year is 2019...
 - that the organization name is Alejandro Hernández...
 - and the organization homepage is https://github.com/alejandrohdezma
 
The following headers will be added to every file:
